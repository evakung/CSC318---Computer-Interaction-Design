Course Project (Android App UI prototype)

The goal of this application was to make fitness at the University of Toronto more accessible and organized.­ By merging U of T’s fitness facilities into one platform, we intended to create and app that displays courses, schedules, payments, and signups in one convenient location.

­Throughout the months, a prototype of the user interface was created for the intended android application (interaction design).

­A number of written reports were submitted at the end of each stage of the software lifecycle iteration based on our prototype.
